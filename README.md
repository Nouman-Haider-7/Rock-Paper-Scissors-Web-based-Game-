🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors — Game On! ⚡
Just wrapped up a fun and interactive browser-based version of the classic game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
With an animated background, glowing UI, and clean logic, this mini-project brings childhood nostalgia to the digital screen.

✨ Features:
✅ Golden-themed responsive UI
🤖 Smart computer opponent logic
📊 Score tracking with real-time updates
🔁 Replay and hover effects for engagement

Building this project sharpened my DOM skills, event handling, and CSS animation techniques. Excited to explore more and level up from here! 🚀
